Round 2 - GDSC VIT VLR CYBERSECURITY: Task-Home

Steps that were taken to find the hidden flag:

1. Downloaded the "home.file" file; I couldn't make any sense of what type of file this is :(
2. Tried opening the file using Notepad, Python( binary file ) only to find a few English phrases amongst a sea of junk.
3. Only then did I notice that it is an executable file.
4. Decided to open the file using a Linux terminal( Installed on my Virtual Box ).
5. Then utilised the "chmod" command on Linux to get permissions to run the executable file in script mode.
6. And voila! The address is: Main ST, 20 East Waton Ave, Maple Rd, Vertinus Hill,91825
